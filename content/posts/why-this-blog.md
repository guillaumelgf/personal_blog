# Introduction

I am Guillaume a Software Engineer who enjoys discovering new things linked to computer science and tech in general.

I worked on **Data Science / Analytics** projects, then moved on to **Data Engineering** and got super into **Backend programming**
while working in a start-up where it was easy to switch roles if motivated.

I then worked a lot with the **Django framework** but still see myself as a "touche Ã  tout".

This blog is just for me to gather programming ideas and showcase them if needed :sparkles: 

## Why ?

I was mainly inspired by a former colleague of mine who also happens to have his own tech blog (check it out [here](https://tomforb.es/)).

He had this idea that working at a company was not a great way to "experiment new things" as it's often cumbersome to build stuff.
You have to prove that your idea is worth the time, write designs, get approved, write "good code" with tests, etc

The best way to learn, for him, was to make as many quick / kind of trashy projects as possible. 
Having a goal reachable in a few days and not get into impossible-to-finish projects with corporate limitations :
- No test
- No refacto

Just you trying a techno or something silly you felt compelled to learn and experiment. Just for "**the joy of coding**". And I want to try that for myself :blush:

## How ?

**How does this blog work ?**

This blog is created with [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/) a simple web framework that generates static websites from markdown files => 
perfect for building blogs, but there is a ton of templates for different usages.


The code for this blog is publicly available on my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/guillaumelgf/personal_blog).


It is then automatically deployed on push by [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/) who also freely hosts the blog. It's easy to use and awesome for this use case !

## What's next ?

We will see as the ideas come along the way :wink:
